The purpose of this gist is to walk through what a regular expression is and how to use them. Regular Expressions (Regex) can be used when one is trying to match a certain character combination within a string. This is great for pulling out information from a given body of code as well as being used for validation. For example, this tutorial will follow an example code snippet that can be used to match an email. This tutorial will follow the different components of regular expressions. 

## Summary

I will be describing the "Matching an Email" regex, or regular expression, as shown here: /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/ A matching email regex would be used to validate an email address. For example, if a user is filling out a form online or answering an inquirer prompt in a node.js program, this regex could be used to make sure they enter an email address when asked for one. Essentially, a regex is defining a search pattern.
